# Graph-Drawing-Program
Program that draw graphs from given data.
Program is abble to draw graphs from given number, you can name the graph, and set a diffrent color for each other. 
You can also export graphs to XML, import them later. If there is too much graphs or they are to big, and they dont fit on screen they resize to  be able to fit. 
Graphs can be sorted from heighest to lowest. In future I`ll propably add more sort options.
